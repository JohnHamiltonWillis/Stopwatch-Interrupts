Stopwatch Interrupts
====================
This program is for a stopwatch with button inputs and seven segment display outputs that utilizes C language interrupts implemented on a Microblaze soft core processor for ELEN 423 Embedded Systems using an Artix-7 FPGA. The interrupt system is used to manage each individual process and have them execute at the appropriate time for the purposes of maintaining accuracy with the timing process.
